This app allows the user to rate five cat photos and gives a conclusion based on their ratings. 
The user inputs their name on the first screen before moving onto the next. Then they rate the cat photos using a text input and two buttons to move back and forth between the photos. By clicking the "Next" button on the second screen, the user moves onto the last screen, where they are informed of their highest and average rating.
